# Felix's Node.js Guide

## About this guide

Hi, I am [Felix Geisend√∂rfer][felixge], an early [node.js][nodejs] core contributor and
co-founder of [transloadit.com][transloadit].

Over the past few month I have given a lot of [talks][talks] and done a lot of
[consulting][consulting] on using node.js.

Since I found myself repeating a lot of things over and over, I decided to use some
of my recent vacation to start this oppionated and unofficial guide to help
people getting started in node.js.

## Content

[Node.js Style Guide](style.html)
  ~ The generell JavaScript style I recommend to use with node.js. A lot of
    this is personal preferences, but hopefully rather consistent.
[Node.js Community Guide](community.html)
  ~ Get to know some of the node.js community and find out where they hang out.

More guides are in the works!
