% Felix's Node.js Community Guide

If you have just read the Beginner's Guide, and you are interested in becoming
more involed with the node.js community, this guide is for you.

## IRC

IRC is a great place to discuss the virtues of vim vs. emacs, as well as getting
support and interaction from people within the node.js community.

The official irc channel for node.js is located on chat.freenode.net^ and named
'#node.js' (yes, the dot is part of the name). There are usually ~500 people in
there these days.

If you have a question, just go ahead and ask it. Depending on who's awake and
paying attention, you often get great replies right away. Otherwise just stick
around and wait for an hour or so. After that it's ok to ask your question again
in case you think it went by unnoticed.

Oh, and you should always try to find your answer on the web first, but you know
that^, right?

## Google Groups

A lot of discussion around node.js takes place via google group mailing lists.
The two official lists are:

nodejs: http://groups.google.com/nodejs^
nodejs-dev: http://groups.google.com/nodejs-dev^

The 'nodejs' list is meant for general node.js questions and discussions. So
generally that's the one you want to use.

If you have found a bug in node.js, or want to get involved in discussion
features & development, feel free to participate in the 'nodejs-dev' mailing
list. It's generally less noisy, and most of the core contributors follow it.

## Twitter

Since twitter cuts off tag names when it sees a dot character, many people use
to tag '#nodejs' to highlight node.js related content on twitter. You can find
the current stream of tweets via their search function:

http://search.twitter.com/?q=#nodejs^

Since not everybody is tagging their content, it's sometimes also good to simply
search for 'node.js' as a term:

http://search.twitter.com/?q=node.js

## Community Members

If you are curious about the people driving the node.js development & ecosystem,
here is a list of a few people whose names you should know.

### Ryan Dahl

Ryan is the creator, maintainer and BDFL^ of node.js. This means any commits
that go into node.js are reviewed by him, and he's the only one who directly
pushes to the node repository.

While Ryan will generally try to respond to questions on the mailing list and
IRC, he's a very busy guy. So don't be upset if he doesn't answer your direct
questions right away, there are usually other people around who can help as
well.

Ryan is currently working for Joyent^, a company that provides great
heroku-style node.js hosting^, and is the official coporate sponsor node.js.

### Marak aka Jim Bastard^

Jim is mostly known for pumping out douzands of node.js libraries per month,
only exceeded by his artful use of profanity and trolling people. Don't get
upset if he rubs you the wrong way, he's a nice guy, but you just shouldn't
challenge him to a Monkey Island style sword duell.

### Your name here

This list is by no means exhaustive and for most parts in random order. My goal
is to keep this list short enough so it doesn't become a list of all node.js
users^, but there are probably a few important names that I forgot. So if you
would like to see your name here as well, just email me.

My criteria for selecting people is a mix of GitHub watchers, community
engagement, willkür^ and might slightly favor people who I've met in person.
